Sublime Color Scheme Editor for Sublime Text

**NOTE**: As Sublime Text has moved away from tmTheme in favor of their new sublime-color-scheme format, motivation to continue working on this tool is not what it used to be. For the forseable future, all development is halted on this project.

## Installation

- Install this package in your Sublime `Packages` folder.
- Pip install [subclrschm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/subclrschm/) version 2.0.2+ in your local Python installation. See install instructions here: http://facelessuser.github.io/subclrschm/installation/.
- Configure your `scheme_editor.sublime-settings` file to call `subclrschm`.

    ```js
    // Path of subclrschm app
    // Just setup call to the app. No need to setup app options as that is controlled
    // by the plugin.
    "editor": {
        "windows": ["python", "-m", "subclrschm"],
        "osx": ["python", "-m", "subclrschm"],
        "linux": ["python", "-m", "subclrschm"]
    }
    ```

## Optional Settings

```js
    // Enable or disable live editing
    // (live editing saves to the file right after changes are made)
    // This is not enabled by default for open with file picker and new themes
    "live_edit": true,

    // Enable or disable direct editing
    // All files are copied to a temp location before editing.
    // If direct edit is enabled, the file will be edited directly
    // except in cases where the theme file is inside a sublime-packages
    // archive
    "direct_edit": false,

    // Allow multiple instances.  By default, the editor will only allow one
    // instance, and if other instances are opened, there arguments will be sent
    // to the one already open.
    "multiple_instances": false,
```

## Usage

All commands are available via the command palette.  Here are the included commands:

```js
    // Open the current theme in the editor
    // (copy to separate location first and set to current theme)
    {
        "caption": "SchemeEditor: Edit Scheme (file picker)",
        "command": "scheme_editor",
        "args": { "live_edit": false }
    },
    // Creates a new theme in the editor
    // (copy to separate location first and set to current theme)
    {
        "caption": "SchemeEditor: Create New Scheme",
        "command": "scheme_editor",
        "args": { "action": "new", "live_edit": false }
    },
    // Open the current theme in the editor
    // (copy to separate location first and set to current theme)
    {
        "caption": "SchemeEditor: Edit Current Scheme",
        "command": "scheme_editor",
        "args": { "action": "current" }
    },
    // Search plugins for themes and choose one to edit
    {
        "caption": "SchemeEditor: Edit installed scheme",
        "command": "scheme_editor_get_scheme"
    },
    // Open log file in Sublime Text
    {
        "caption": "SchemeEditor: Get Editor Log",
        "command": "scheme_editor_log"
    },
    // Clear Temp Folder
    {
        "caption": "SchemeEditor: Clear Temp Folder",
        "command": "scheme_clear_temp"
    }
```

## Questions

*How can I get undefined scopes into the editor?*

ScopeHunter is a plugin I wrote that you can configure to put the scope of what is under the cursor into your clipboard (it also can show you a lot of other stuff, but you configure it how you want it to work). So you can use that to quickly get the scope into your clipboard, then you can open up the scheme editor.

The SublimeText3 documentation has a page on scope naming: http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html.
